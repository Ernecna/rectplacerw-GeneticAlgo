This project explores the use of genetic algorithms to optimally place nine rectangles within a predefined area. It employs a Java application that reads rectangle dimensions and the area constraints from an input file, then iteratively applies genetic algorithm techniques—selection, crossover, and mutation—to find an arrangement that minimizes overlap and maximizes the efficient use of space.

The core of the application resides in two classes: RectangleProject, which handles the graphical representation and initial placement logic, and Population, which encapsulates the genetic algorithm operations, including the creation of initial populations, fitness calculation, selection for crossover, and the application of crossover and mutation operations to evolve towards an optimal solution.

The RectangleProject class includes methods for drawing the rectangles in a GUI, ensuring that rectangles do not overlap by attempting different positions and orientations before finalizing their placement. It dynamically calculates the "fitness" of an arrangement by the degree to which it conserves space, aiming to minimize the total area not covered by rectangles.

On the other hand, the Population class (not detailed here) likely contains methods that manage populations of rectangle arrangements, each represented as an individual within the genetic algorithm. It would include functionality to evaluate the fitness of each arrangement, select the most promising candidates for reproduction, and generate new populations through crossover and mutation, thereby exploring the space of possible arrangements to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

The genetic algorithm's iterative process of selection, reproduction, and mutation, guided by the principle of survival of the fittest, allows the program to efficiently explore a vast space of possible rectangle arrangements. This approach is particularly effective for solving complex optimization problems like this one, where traditional methods might struggle to find an optimal solution within a reasonable timeframe.

This project demonstrates the practical application of genetic algorithms in solving spatial optimization problems, showcasing the power of evolutionary computation techniques in finding solutions to complex problems that are difficult to solve through conventional algorithms.
